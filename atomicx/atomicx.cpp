/**
 * @file atomicx.cpp
 * @brief AtomicX Library Header
 *
 * This file contains the definitions and declarations for the AtomicX library.
 * AtomicX is designed to provide a lightweight threading and synchronization
 * mechanism suitable for small microprocessors, such as AVR, which have limited
 * C++ standard library support. Also support for Arduino and other embedded
 * systems and operating systems like FreeRTOS, windows, and Linux and macOS.
 *
 * @note The use of old-style includes and certain object handling methods is 
 * due to the need for compatibility with simple and small microprocessors. 
 * These microprocessors, like AVR, often do not support the full C++ Standard 
 * Library (STL). To address this, some STL functionalities have been ported 
 * to ensure synchronization support and compatibility with build systems that 
 * do not support the full STL.
 *
 * @version 2.0.0.proto
 * @date __TIMESTAMP__
